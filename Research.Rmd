## Past Research


### James Madison University

I worked with a professor at my undergraduate institution by working on the literature search for a study that was looking at the relationship between body image, eating disorders, and social media in college students. I also worked in a group on a research project that was awarded in the top 3 research posters of the department. The research explored the relationship between narcissism and perceived acceptance rates to graduate programs among James Madison University students who planned on going into a health-related field.

### Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health

I was previously involved in research with ICAP and my academic adviser at Columbia, Dr. Susan Michaels-Strasser. The first project was a case study from Democratic Republic of the Congo and aimed to determine ways to strengthen human resources for health in order to achieve epidemic control of HIV/AIDS. The second project was a case study based in Democratic Republic of the Congo and was aimed at creating interventions to improve rural rotations of nursing students and , eventually, increase the amount of nurses in rural health facilities.

## Current Research

I am currently working on a cross-sectional survey study that aims to explore the experience of healthcare workers at a New York City hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.
